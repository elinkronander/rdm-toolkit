## What kind of storage solution should you choose?

There are several different types of storage solutions, for example 
* Local storage on your harddrive or local servers
* High Performance Computer clusters
* S3 Secure Storage for sensitive data 
* Public Repositories
* Cloud Service Solutions

Depending on what type of data you wish to store, some might be more suitable than others.
The timeline and purpose of the storage are also deciding factors for choosing
a storage solution.

### Considerations about the data
* What volume of data do you need a storage solution for?
* Who will need to access the data, only yourself, internal or external collaborators?
* How often will the data be accessed, is it being actively worked on or mainly stored in the current version?
* Do you need the storage solution to be compatible with certain analysis tools?
* Is your data sensitive? 

### Considerations about the type of storage solution
* What are the backup procedures for this storage solution?
* What are the costs associated with this storage solution?
* How sustainable is this storage solution, ie. how is it maintained and funded?

### Solutions
To find out what storage solutions are available to you and which one fits your needs, you can reach out to the IT-department of your host institution or a National Infrastructure for your domain or specialised on computing services if those exists in your country.

For active data, it is important that it is easily accessible for everyone that needs to work with it. See reccomendations on how to store your data during the course of your project below.
For sensitive data, consider the security and privacy guidelines.
For storing your data in a way for others to find and access it, consider a public repository. See below.
For Big data, local storage is often not suitable.

## How to store your data during the course of your project?

To ensure that research data are easy to find and accessible as well as the results are prepared to be reproduced and reused data should be stored already from the beginning of a project and should be kept active during the project duration. 

### Considerations
* Technical considerations and costs (storage space, in-house versions, backups etc.)
* Security and data protection rules
* Usage of standard formats, identifiers, ontologies, controlled vocabularies
* Storage of metadata from the beginning 
* Storge of all available data of an experiment (raw data, processed results, protocols, methods etc.)
* Variable access permissions and sharing definitions during the project (private data or intermediate results versus shared or published data)

### Solutions 
* FAIRDOMHub/SEEK
* iPODS


## Submitting your data to a public repository for publication?

Once you have completed your project and are ready to submit your results for publication you may be required to be deposit the data in a recognised open repository prior to the article submission. Most likely you will be required to comply with the data sharing policy, of the journal and hence will need to find a suitable repository for your data. Additionally, it is highly encouraged that you consider the FAIR Data Principles when depositing your data.

Depending on the type of data youâ€™ll need to find suitable repository relevant to your data type and discipline. In certain cases, your Institution or University may also provide you a centralised repository for storing the data, which will be open to members. However, for some data types, such as the high throughput sequencing data it is essential that the data are deposited in ArrayExpress or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In these cases, only the community recognised repositories should be used.

In case a subject-specific repository is not available, you may consider some of the generalist repositories listed in the resource section.

### Considerations
Once you deciding to deposit your data to a public repository you will be asked to provide information about the nature of the data being deposited. You may be asked whether your data is :
  Personal or sensitive
  Commercially-sensitive 
  Some form of confidential/restricted information 
  Do you have the rights to share the data via the Repository
  Rights or permission to store the data 

### General repositories
4TU.Datacentrum
ANDS contributing repositories
Dryad Digital Repository
Figshare
Harvard Dataverse
Mendeley Data
Open Science Framework
Zenodo
Code Ocean
